# 🚀 Steam Mobile App UX Redesign – HCI Project

A high-impact UX redesign project focused on improving the **Steam mobile app** by applying Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles and heuristic evaluation techniques. This project was conducted as part of a graduate HCI course and involved redesigning key app areas including the **Store**, **Library**, and **Chat**.

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project was to:

- Improve **usability**, **navigation**, and **visual consistency**
- Reduce **cognitive load**, misclicks, and interface confusion
- Align mobile UX more closely with the **Steam desktop experience**
- Apply foundational HCI principles such as **Fitts’ Law**, **Hick’s Law**, **Affordance**, and **Progressive Disclosure**

## 🧩 Key Redesign Highlights

- Simplified **Store**, **Library**, and **Chat** screens with reduced clutter and better information hierarchy
- Integrated **Steam Guard** tutorials and step-by-step guidance for improved system transparency
- Unified navigation system modeled after the desktop client for better transfer and consistency
- Improved visibility with interactive feedback, active state indicators, and cleaner iconography
- Applied accessibility improvements including spacing, high-contrast layouts, and structured menus

## 🧪 Design Principles Applied

This project incorporated over **20 HCI principles**, including:

- **Affordance and Constraints**
- **Feedback and Visibility of System Status**
- **Recognition over Recall**
- **Fitts' and Hick’s Laws**
- **Consistency and Mapping**
- **Multitasking and Causality**
- **Flexibility vs Usability Trade-offs**

## 🔍 Heuristic Evaluation Insights

- **Improved Navigation**: Bottom tabs mirror the desktop experience for easier learning
- **Affordance Clarity**: Buttons, icons, and gestures are more intuitive
- **Error Reduction**: Clear confirmation prompts and undo options minimize accidental actions
- **Fitts’ Law**: Larger tap areas and bottom-aligned navigation minimize misclicks
- **Hick’s Law**: Streamlined menus reduce decision fatigue

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Figma** – High-fidelity mockups and interactive prototypes
- **Adobe Illustrator** – Custom icon design
- **Miro** – Flow mapping and interaction planning
- **Google Docs** – Report drafting and collaboration
